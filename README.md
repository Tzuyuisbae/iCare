To run the app, go to directory icare and run `npm install` in terminal, then run `npm run start` and it will open a new tab as localhost:3000. To run the backend server, open another terminal and go to the /server directory and run `nodemon app.js` or `node app.js` if you do not have nodemon installed. Instructions on how to use the app are written in the CodeReview and Acceptance test in D5 folder.

To run the automated unit test, open the terminal and change directory to server/test. Then to install test dependencies run `npm install`. Then to run the tests, run `npm test`.

Note: the database may be initialized with values and tables that may conflict with the test cases and cause them to fail.
