### Sai Oduri

<img src="images/SaiOduri.jpg" alt="test" width = "10%">

I am currently a fourth-year computer science student at the University of Toronto, who is very interested in Software Engineering as well as Web Development.

Outside of school, my hobbies include rock climbing, gymming, and videography. I'm quite the outdoorsy person and a huge extrovert, despite my interest in computer science.

My passions in life are developing code, writing articles, editing videos, teaching students, taking photos and exploring the world. Feel free to check out my article on habit formation on my <a href="https://medium.com/@saioduri/habit-formation-f137c9a4289d">Medium</a>
